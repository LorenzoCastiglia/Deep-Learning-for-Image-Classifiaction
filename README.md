# Deep Learning for Image Classifiaction

This is the implementation of an assignment from the Master of Science's course "Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning" of Politecnico di Milano. The project was done in a group of 3, in collaboration with my colleagues Davide Mantegazza and Gabriele Bozzetto.

In this homework we were required to design and train a model to classify images of leafs, which are divided into categories according to the species of the plant to which they belong. Being a classification problem, given an image, the goal is to predict the correct class label. A sample of each class is shown in the image below.



We implemented various CNNs and explored aspects such as regularization, dropout, data augmentation, bias-variance tradeoff, transfer learning, and fine tuning. Our best model exceeded 90% accuracy on the test set.

Each notebook contains a particular model, with images of the architecture and its performance on the validation set. Further details are found in the "AN2DL HW01 report.pdf" file.
